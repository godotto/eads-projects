\section{Introduction}

The aim of the project is to implement an AVL tree based dictionary in the C++ programming
language with use of template feature. As it is dictionary, the main class has two 
generic parameters â€“ {\tt Key} and {\tt Info}. We assume that {\tt Key} is unique
and if new data with already existing key is being aded, {\tt Info} is replaced with new
value. Additional requirement is to print the structure in a way that root is on the left
hand side of screen and leaves are on the right hand side.
